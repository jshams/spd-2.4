## [Problem 1:](middle_item.py) **Middle Item**
Given a singly-linked list, find the middle item in the list.   
Example: If the given linked list is `A → B → C → D → E`, return `C`.

## [Problem 2:](reverse_ll.py) **Reverse Linked List**
Given a singly-linked list, reverse the order of the list by modifying the nodes’ links.   
Example: If the given linked list is `A → B → C → D → E`, nodes should be modified/rearranged so the list becomes `E → D → C → B → A`.

---

## [Problem 3:](interleave.py) **Interlieve Linked List**
Given a linked list, rearrange the elements by interleaving the first half of the linked list with the second half.   
Example: If the given linked list is `A → B → C → D → E → F → G → H`, nodes should be rearranged so the list becomes `A → C → E → G → B → D → F → H`.

---

## [Problem 4:](rotate_ll.py) **Rotate Linked List**
Rotate a given linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes, where k is a given integer.   
Example: If the given linked list is `A → B → C → D → E → F` and `k=4`, nodes should be modified so the list becomes `E → F → A → B → C → D`.

## [Problem 5:](combine_sorted_lls.py) **Combine Sorted Linked Lists**
Given an array of k linked lists, each of whose items are in sorted order, combine all nodes (do not create new nodes) into a single linked list with all items in order.
