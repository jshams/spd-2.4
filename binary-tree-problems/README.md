# Binary Tree Problems

## [Problem 1:](reverse_tree.py) **Reverse Tree**
Given a binary search tree, reverse the order of its values by modifying the nodes’ links.

## [Problem 2:](tree_two_sum.py) **Binary Tree Two Sum**

Given a binary search tree containing integers and a target integer, come up with an efficient way to locate two nodes in the tree whose sum is equal to the target value.

## [Problem 3:](max_sum_path.py) **Maximum Sum Path**
Given a binary tree containing numbers, find the maximum sum path (the path that has the largest sum of node values). The path may start and end at any node in the tree.

## [Problem 4:](superbalanced.py) **Superbalanced Trees**
Let’s say a binary tree is "superbalanced" if the difference between the depths of any two leaf nodes is at most one. Write a function to check if a binary tree is "superbalanced".

## [Problem 5:](bst_is_valid.py) **BST Is Valid**
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a valid binary search tree (values in order).

## [Problem 6:](bst_to_dll.py) **Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly-Linked List**
Given a binary search tree, convert it into a sorted doubly-linked list by modifying the original tree nodes (do not create new nodes).
